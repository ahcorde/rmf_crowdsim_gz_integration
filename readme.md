# Gazebo Plugin Written in Rust: Crowd sim integration

This repo contains my experiments with rust + gazebo.

You will need Gazebo Garden installed. To build this repo simply run:
```
colcon build
```

`corrosion-rs` and `cargo` will take care of the rest of the magic.

## C-API documentation
Complete documentation for the C-API  can be found [here](rust_system/src/rust_interface.h)
